        <summary>36.what are the ways of getting code from github?</summary>
        <p>There are several ways to get code from GitHub, depending on your needs. Here are the main methods: <br>
            1. Cloning a Repository <br>
            Description: Creates a local copy of a GitHub repository on your machine. <br>
            2. Downloading as a ZIP File <br>
            Description: Download the entire repository as a ZIP file, which can be extracted locally. <br>
            How to Do It: <br>
            Go to the repository page on GitHub. <br>
            Click on the green "Code" button. <br>
            Select "Download ZIP."<br>
            3. Using GitHub Desktop<br>
            Description: A graphical interface for Git that allows you to clone repositories and manage them easily.<br>
            How to Do It:<br>
            Install GitHub Desktop.<br>
            Sign in with your GitHub account.<br>
            Use the "Clone a repository" option to get the code.<br>
            4. Forking a Repository<br>
            Description: Creates a personal copy of someone else's repository under your GitHub account, allowing you to make changes without affecting the original.<br>

        <summary>37.know the d/f b/w the all type of getting code?</summary>
        <p>Cloning provides full version control capabilities, allowing for collaboration and changes to be tracked. <br>
            Downloading as ZIP is a simple way to access code without version control features, making it easy but limiting for collaboration. <br>
            GitHub Desktop offers a user-friendly interface for Git, making it easier for those unfamiliar with command-line tools, but it still relies on Git. <br>
            Forking is ideal for contributing to projects, as it allows you to work independently while keeping the ability to propose changes back to the original repository.
