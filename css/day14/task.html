    <details>
        <summary>1.what is css?why do we use it?</summary>
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for example, to alter the font, color,
            size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative
            features</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>2.In how many ways can we create css styling?What are they?</summary>
        <pre>
            There are three primary ways to style using CSS:

            Inline CSS: Styles applied directly to HTML elements using the style attribute.
            Internal CSS: Styles defined within a "style" tag in the HTML document's "head" section.
            External CSS: Styles written in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML document.</pre>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>3.d.f b/w 3 ways of css styling?</summary>
        <pre>
            Inline CSS: Styles applied directly to elements; quick but not reusable.
            Internal CSS: Styles in "style" tag in HTML; good for single-page styling.
            External CSS: Separate .css file; best for reusable and maintainable styles across multiple pages.
        </pre>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>4.What is specificity among the ways of css styling?</summary>
        <p>Specificity Order: Inline > Internal > External. Higher specificity overrides lower.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>5.What is the syntax of css?</summary>
        <p>The syntax of CSS consists of a selector followed by a declaration block:</p>
        <p>Selector: Targets HTML elements (e.g., p for paragraph).</p>
        <p>Declaration Block: Contains property-value pairs (e.g., color: blue;).</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>6.What is a selector?</summary>
        <p>A selector in CSS is a pattern used to select and apply styles to HTML elements. It defines which elements on

    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>7.How many types of selectors?</summary>

            1. Basic Selectors:
                Element Selector: Targets HTML elements (e.g., div, p).
                Class Selector: Targets elements with a specific class (e.g., .classname).
                ID Selector: Targets a specific element with an ID (e.g., #idname).
            2. Group Selectors:
                Combines multiple selectors to apply the same styles (e.g., h1, h2, h3 { color: blue; }).
            3. Attribute Selectors:
                Selects elements based on attributes (e.g., [type="text"]).
            4. Pseudo-class Selectors:
                Targets elements based on their state (e.g., :hover, :focus).
            5. Pseudo-element Selectors:
                Targets a specific part of an element (e.g., ::before, ::first-line).
            6. Combinators:
                Descendant Selector: Selects elements that are descendants of a specified element (e.g., div p).
                Child Selector: Selects elements that are direct children of a specified element (e.g., ul > li).
                Adjacent Sibling Selector: Selects an element that is immediately next to another (e.g., h1 + p).
                General Sibling Selector: Selects all siblings of a specified element (e.g., h1 ~ p).
        </pre>
    </details>
    <details>

                Universal: * selects all elements.

                Class: .classname selects by class.
                ID: #idname selects by ID.
                Attribute: [attr="value"] selects by attribute.
                Descendant: ancestor descendant selects nested elements.
                Child: parent > child selects direct children.
                Adjacent Sibling: first + second selects the next sibling.
                General Sibling: first ~ siblings selects all siblings.
